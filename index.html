				<h3>Important points in his life:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>1930</strong> - Harvey Milk was born in New York on May 22.</li>
					<li><strong>1951</strong> - Graduated from the New York State College for Teachers in Albany, now called the State University of New York at Albany. After graduation, he joined the US Navy and served during the Korean War on the USS Kittiwake, and later at Naval Station, San Diego.</li>
					<li><strong>1955</strong> - Left the Navy and began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island.</li>
					<li><strong>1969</strong> - Visited San Francisco as part of a theatre company, fell in love with the city, and decided to stay.</li>
					<li><strong>1973</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Opened a camera shop on Castro Street with his last $1,000.</li>
							<li>While working at this camera shop, changing national politics and harassment from local officials angered Milk and it was then he decided to join the political world.</li>
							<li>He began running on a culturally liberal platform: supporting the reorganization of local supervisors to reduce the influence of money on elections, opposing government interference in private sexual matters, and supporting legalizating marijuana.</li>
							<li>Even though he lost his first election run, he used his popularity to assist the LGBT community around Castro street, mainly using organized labor unions to fight for equality.</li>
							<li>He also started the Castro Village Association in response to city officials discriminating against gay business owners.</li>
						</ul>
					<li><strong>1974</strong> - Started the Castro Street Fair, stunning conservative locals with its overwhelming success.</li>
					<li><strong>1977</strong> - Won the supervisor seat.</li>
					<li><strong>1978</strong> - Along with President of the Board of Supervisors George Moscone, both were assassinated by Dan White, another supervisor who was disgruntled with Moscone for not reinstating him to his position.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>His contributions while in office:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Passing an anti-discrimination law based on sexual orientation</li>
					<li>The "pooper scooper law" to try to clean up sidewalks around the city</li>
					<li>Fought against the Briggs Initiative, and with the help of Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, and Jerry Brown, defeated the proposition</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>
					<p>On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country ... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets ... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. We are coming out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I'm going to talk about it. And I want you to talk about it. You must come out. Come out to your parents, your relatives.</p>
					<cite>-- Harvey Milk, from "The Hope Speech", 1978</cite>
